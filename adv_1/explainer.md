# Deep Learning Project

The project is our first attempt at implementing and training a convolutional neural network.
In this project we attempt to predict the type of a coffee bean out of given 4 classes. (multi class classification problem).
We created 3 different models in order to solve the problem and find out the best design for the problem. 

We use google colab with a pythonic notebook.
There is a heavy use of the tensorflow and numpy libraries in the project.

[Code Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mdxkBVxHSbFv6tS7dezkQ4yxqvVtjhk0)

## Colab notebook structure:
The notebook is divided to 4 sections:

0. Utiles
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Models (experiments, training and evaluation matrixes)
3. Test Environment

## Running on the saved model
in order to download the already trained model one can simply use the run all button (or run the testing environment section).

## Installation - Must before training or testing

Run "UÖ¹tils" section to download and extract the data zip (which contains the training and testing images).

### Train model

1. Run "Data Processing" section to view a sample of the images and load them to the memory before the training.
2. Run "Models" section to train the models and display the relevant graphs for each one of them.

### Test model

1. Run "Test Environment" section
2. upload any number of png files of the correct size
3. take a look at the `predict` part to see the predictions for your images
